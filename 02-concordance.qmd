1.  What is a concordance?

2.  What can we learn from looking at concordance lines?

3. My typical workflow in analysing concordance

4.  Demo & Practice

## What is a concordance?

::: incremental
-   “a collection of the occurrences of a word-form, each in its own textual environment. In its simplest form, it is an index. Each word-form is indexed, and a reference is given to the place of each occurrence in a text” [@sinclair1991, 32].

-   “gives contextual information about a word” [@barth2021, 82].

## What is a concordance? {.scrollable}

MS Word `find` is a kind of concordance!

```{r msword-conc}
#| echo: false
#| label: msword-conc
#| fig-align: left
#| out-width: 7in
#| out-height: 4in
#| fig-asp: .68
#| fig-width: 7
#| fig-dpi: 300
#| fig-scap: "A concordance in MS Word"

knitr::include_graphics("img/05-word-conc.png")
```

## What is a concordance? Key Word in Context (KWIC)

KWIC: a modern-day format of a concordance.

```{r ske-charm}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 7in
#| out-height: 4in
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-dpi: 300
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 3
#| fig-subcap: "A snippet of SE's [concordance of the lemma *CHARM*](https://ske.li/15y) in _English Web 2021_"

knitr::include_graphics("img/05-ske-conc-charm-lemma.png")
```

## What is a concordance?

Take away:

-   essentially a means to display (raw, unanalysed) data more efficiently

-   does not perform the analysis to answer the research question

    -   *we*, the researcher, need to analyse them in such a way that these concordance data could provide answer to our research question(s).

    -   It is insufficient just to know the how-to of *corpus* linguistics, but also the *linguistics* side.

## What can we learn from looking at concordance lines? {.scrollable}

Electronic concordance can be sorted (alphabetically) in various ways [@tribble2010, 175]:

-   by the node/target word/lemma/phrase

-   by the left context of the node

-   by the right context of the node

These sorting help reveals different kinds of usages of the node [cf. @hunston2002, 42-52].

Left-context sorting for the [concordance of *charm*](https://ske.li/15z). Any regularity/pattern?

## What can we learn from looking at concordance lines? {.scrollable}

See Hunston[-@hunston2002, 42-52] for details of the following points.

- “Observing the ‘central’ and ‘typical’”

    - <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">in frequency terms</span>

- “Observing meaning distinctions”

    - <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">different usage patterns of near-synonyms</span>

- “Observing meaning and patterns”

    - <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">distinct senses/meanings of a word and their patternings (lexical, morpho-syntactical, morphological, etc.)</span>
    
    - “<span style="color:SteelBlue">Distinguishing between the meanings is a matter of distinguishing between patterns of usage.” [@hunston2002, 47]</span>

- “Observing detail”

    - <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">mass of data, more specific observation of individual words</span>
    
    - e.g., <span style="color:SteelBlue">different semantic type of verbs following the phrase *advice~noun~ as to* [@hunston2002, 52]</span>
