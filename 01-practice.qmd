For this practice, we will use the `Brown Family (CLAWS + TreeTagger tags)` corpus.

## Practice 1: Words beginning with certain strings

We will compare the results of retrieving words starting with certain strings/character using two approaches:

a.  Retrieving all words then filter

b.  Directly using BASIC's `starting with` approach

Pay attention to the results. Why do you think they differ?

-   IMPLICATION 1: some limitation of SE regarding their result outputs.

-   IMPLICATION 2: important for our aim to target/generate specific list with certain criteria using more targeted feature.

### First approach: The basic, find all approach then filtering

1.  In the `BASIC` tab (@fig-basic), select: **words** \> **all** \> [**GO**]{style="color:firebrick"}

```{r}
#| label: fig-basic
#| fig-cap: "Wordlist `BASIC` interface searching for all words"
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/04-practice-00-basic.png")
```

2.  On the output page of the Wordlist (see @fig-filter), click on the `Filter` feature (i.e., the up-side-down triangle lines, to the right of the "eye-like" symbol on the upper right corner).

3.  Select the option `Starting with` as shown in @fig-filter below.

```{r}
#| label: fig-filter
#| fig-cap: "`Filter` option in the Wordlist output, choosing the `Starting with` condition."
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("img/04-practice-01-filter.png")
```

4.  Type in "kn" in the field

5.  Press `Enter`; the result is shown in @fig-kn-result

```{r}
#| label: fig-kn-result
#| fig-cap: "Output of filtering words starting with `kn` in the all word list."
#| echo: false

knitr::include_graphics("img/04-practice-02-filter-results.png")
```

You will get five items.

### Second approach (your turn): The basic, `Starting with` feature

1.  In the `BASIC` tab, instead of using **words** \> **all**, use **words** \> **starting with**

2.  Then, type `kn` then hit [**GO**]{style="color:firebrick"}

3.  Compare the current results with that in @fig-kn-result. How many do you get? (Answer key (you need to LOGIN ðŸ˜’): <https://ske.li/15i>)

    3.1. Why do they differ?

## Practice 2: Words of certain word-class/part-of-speech containing certain affixes

We are still in the `BASIC` tab. We will explore the productivity (the number of different items/type frequency) of English adjectives containing suffixes. We focus on suffixes meaning 'having a resemblance of', particularly comparing -*esque* (which has a more specialised meaning of 'in the style of \~') and -*ish* [see @bauer2022, 55].

### Requirement

-   IMPORTANT: This involves results from two searches: one for each suffix

-   Later, in the output interface, look at the upper left corner to find basic quantitative information:

    -   the number of items (i.e., the type frequency)

    -   the total frequency of these items (i.e., the token frequency especially of adjectives having these suffixes)

### Task

-   Conceptual aspect:

    -   try to intuite which suffix would be more productive, in terms of their type and token frequency, in the corpus we use (later check this intuition with the results).

-   Operationalisation:

    -   How would you device a targeted search using just the `BASIC` feature to retrieve **only adjectives** ending with these suffixes? ðŸ¤”

    -   REMEMBER: you need to run two searches for each suffix

-   Results:

    -   How many items there are for -*esque* and what is the total frequency of these -*esque* adjectives? (Answer key: <https://ske.li/15k>)

    -   How many items there are for -*ish* and what is the total frequency of these -*ish* adjectives? (Answer key: <https://ske.li/15l>)

    -   Which suffix is more productive (in terms of the total number of items) in this `Brown Family (CLAWS + TreeTagger tags)` corpus? Is your intuition supported by the data?
