## What is a frequency list?

-   "The most basic corpus-linguistic tool" [@gries2017, 12]

-   How often a given [linguistic unit]{.underline} occurs in a corpus

    -   Often, this unit is a *word*

## What is a frequency list?

![*Words* (starting with `gl`) and their frequency of occurrences](img/01-freqlist-simple.png){fig-align="left"}

# But, what's a word? ü§î

## What is a word?

::: incremental
::: extrapad
-   "entities in text that are separated by either white-space or punctuation." [@weisser2016, 147]

    -   how about: *can't*, *widely-held*, *co-operate*, or *white-space*?
:::
:::

## What is a word?

### *English compound*

::: incremental
-   **written together**: *icecream* (14,590 matches)

-   **hypenated**: *ice-cream* (55,506 matches)

-   **separated by white-space**: *ice cream* (676,402 matches)
:::

Searches done in *English Web 2021* in Sketch Engine (SE)

## What is a word?

-   Practical consideration: *tool-specific*

-   In SE:

    -   "begin with a letter of the alphabet" (<https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/word/>)

    -   Examples: *book*, *working*, *Mary*, *T-shirt*, *post-1945*, *mp3* or *CO2*

-   Methodological consideration:

    -   be explicit about word criteria (e.g., in the tool used)

## Two basic types of frequency

> Types vs. Tokens [cf. @cheng2012, 62; @gries2017, 12]

-   Types: the number of unique/distinct words in a corpus

-   Tokens:

    -   the total occurrences of all (unique) words in a corpus

    -   the total occurrences of **a** (unique) word in a corpus

## Two basic types of frequency

> Types vs. Tokens [cf. @cheng2012, 62; @gries2017, 12]

*The sky is sky blue while the estuary is turquoise.*

::: incremental
-   Tokens: 10 (2 tokens of *sky*, 2 tokens of *the*, 2 tokens of *is*, ...)

-   Types: 7 (*the*, *sky*, *is*, *blue*, ...)

## Two basic types of frequency {.scrollable}

> absolute vs. relative

-   absolute frequency:

    -   real, observed freq. of an item in the (sub)corpus

-   relative frequency:

    -   normalised frequency of an item on the basis of a base frequency (usually 1 million word-tokens) (cf. [SE's page here](https://www.sketchengine.eu/my_keywords/freqmill/) for the formula)

    -   often used in comparing frequency of the same word in two different corpus that are not equal in size

-   SE allows both options.

How to compute the relative frequency of a linguistic item

$$
Rel. Freq = \frac{absolute frequency \times 1,000,000}{corpus size}
$$

## Two basic types of frequency {.scrollable}

> absolute vs. relative

### Relative frequency: Examples

Say, in the ICE-GB corpus, you found the following [see @gries2010, 271] :

-   297 tokens of *give* (in the **spoken** sub-corpus)

-   144 tokens of *give* (in the **written** sub-corpus)

-   128 tokens of *bring* (in the **spoken** sub-corpus)

-   69 tokens of *bring* (in the **written** sub-corpus)

The size of [ICE-GB~spoken~ is 637,682]{style="color:crimson"} (word-tokens) while the size of [ICE-GB~written~ is 423,581]{style="color:crimson"} (word-tokens). The relative frequencies of *give* and *bring* in the two sub-corpora become:

$$
give_s : \frac{297 \times 1,000,000}{637,682} \approx 465.75
$$

$$
give_w : \frac{144 \times 1,000,000}{423,581} \approx 339.96
$$

$$
bring_s : \frac{128 \times 1,000,000}{637,682} \approx 200.73
$$

$$
bring_w : \frac{69 \times 1,000,000}{423,581} \approx 162.9
$$

### Take away

Important to know how to compute relative frequency!

Sometimes (most of the time?), the corpus-software tool we use **cannot** do what we want.

### Examples

```{r affix-productivity, fig.cap="Productivity analysis (based on __relative type frequency__) of four Indonesian verbal prefixes across genres [@rajeg2023]."}
#| echo: false
#| out-width: 7in

## Frequency of different linguistic units {.scrollable}

-   words

    -   words and their word class (i.e., part-of-speech)

    -   words containing particular strings/characters (e.g., prefixes/suffixes)

    -   ...

-   lemmas

    -   the base/uninflected form of words from a given part-of-speech

        -   the verbs *go*, *went*, *going*, *gone*, *goes* are word-forms for the same lemma GO

-   n-grams (multi-word units with n-number of components)

    -   *part of the*, *for the purposes*, *on behalf of the*, ...

-   word sequence, phrases

    -   phrases containing a fixed word

    -   ...

## Uses of (word-)frequency list {.scrollable}

-   List of frequently occurring lexical items (e.g., General Service List \[West 1953\], Academic Word List \[Coxhead 2000\])

-   Usage-based Cognitive Linguistics

    -   degree of productivity (based on type frequency) and cognitive entrenchment (based on token frequency) of certain linguistic units

-   Choosing experimental stimuli

-   Spelling error correction

-   Determining vocabulary sizes of learners

-   Selection and ordering of language features in course textbooks

-   In other corpus linguistic tools: keyword and collocation statistics

-   ...

    -   Display as:

        -   check `tag`

        -   check `lemma` (check the `A = a` of `lemma`)

    -   Text types:

        -   doc.genre: Mystery sub-genre of Fiction

        -   doc.region: American

-   Results (demo)
